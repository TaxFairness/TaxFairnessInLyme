# Lyme NH Conservation & Current Use Lands

The images in this folder show a map of various kinds of land uses in the Town of Lyme, NH.

The map was prepared and printed by David Robbins and given to Rusty Keith when he was on the Select Board, likely in mid-to-late 2018.

These images are a scan of that paper map.

The Legend backgrounds indicate:

* Green: Property with no conservation or current use restrictions
* White with green details: Land in Current Use
* Diagonal crosshatch: Property with permanent conservation easement
* Brown: Town-owned property
* Diagonal/red crosshatch: Federal lands
